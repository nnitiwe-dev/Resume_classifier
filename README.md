# Resume_classifier
Resume Classification  is a project that builds a model to sort candidate CVs and predict candidates invited for an Interview and candidates not invited. 

## Data Source
Resumes in this dataset were queried from Indeed.com with keyword 'data scientist', location 'Vermont'. It contains a total of 125 Resumes (33 invited for the Interview and 92 Candidates not invited). If a resume is 'not flagged', the applicant can submit a modified resume version at a later date. If it is 'flagged', the applicant is invited to interview.
